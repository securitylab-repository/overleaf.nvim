# overleaf.nvim

Neovim plugin for real-time collaborative LaTeX editing on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

Edit your Overleaf projects directly in Neovim with full real-time collaboration support via Operational Transformation (OT). Use your favorite Neovim plugins — treesitter, LSP, snippets, copilot, and more — while collaborating with others on Overleaf.

## Features

- **Real-time collaboration** — edits sync instantly with other Overleaf users via OT
- **Full Neovim ecosystem** — treesitter, LSP, snippets, copilot, and all your plugins work out of the box
- **File tree** — browse and manage project files in a sidebar
- **Auto-authentication** — extracts session cookie from Chrome automatically (macOS)
- **Auto-reconnect** — recovers from disconnects and document restores seamlessly
- **Compile & PDF preview** — compile LaTeX and open the PDF
- **Comments & reviews** — view, reply, resolve comment threads
- **Collaborator cursors** — see where other users are editing
- **Project-wide search** — grep across all documents
- **File management** — create, delete, rename, upload files
- **History** — view project version history
- **Diagnostics** — chktex linter + LaTeX compile errors via `vim.diagnostic`
- **LSP support** — auto-attaches texlab, ltex, harper_ls to overleaf buffers
- **Local file sync** — mirror documents to disk for external tools (Claude Code, etc.)

## Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.10
- Node.js >= 18
- An [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) account
- Chrome / Chromium (for automatic cookie extraction) or a session cookie

## Installation

### lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  'richwomanbtc/overleaf.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('overleaf').setup()
  end,
  build = 'cd node && npm install',
}
```

If Node.js is not on your default PATH (e.g., installed via Homebrew on macOS):

```lua
{
  'richwomanbtc/overleaf.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('overleaf').setup({
      node_path = '/opt/homebrew/bin/node',
    })
  end,
  build = 'cd node && npm install',
}
```

### Manual

```sh
git clone https://github.com/richwomanbtc/overleaf.nvim ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/overleaf.nvim
cd ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/overleaf.nvim/node && npm install
```

## Authentication

### Option 1: Chrome (automatic)

Just log in to [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com) in Chrome. The plugin extracts the session cookie automatically. If you have multiple Chrome profiles, you'll be prompted to select one.

### Option 2: Manual cookie

Create a `.env` file in your working directory:

```
OVERLEAF_COOKIE=your_overleaf_session2_cookie_here
```

Or pass it directly in setup:

```lua
require('overleaf').setup({
  cookie = 'your_overleaf_session2_cookie_here',
})
```

> **Warning:** If you use this method, make sure your Neovim config is not committed to a public dotfiles repository — the cookie would grant full access to your Overleaf account.

To get the cookie manually: open overleaf.com in your browser → DevTools (F12) → Application → Cookies → `www.overleaf.com` → find `overleaf_session2` → copy the cookie value (starts with `overleaf_session2=s%3A...`).

## Configuration

```lua
require('overleaf').setup({
  -- Path to .env file containing OVERLEAF_COOKIE (default: '.env')
  env_file = '.env',

  -- Session cookie (overrides .env)
  cookie = nil,

  -- Path to Node.js binary (default: 'node')
  node_path = 'node',

  -- Log level: 'debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error' (default: 'info')
  log_level = 'info',

  -- Local file sync directory for external tools like Claude Code (default: nil = disabled)
  -- When set, all documents are mirrored to disk and external changes are synced back.
  -- Also required for SyncTeX forward/inverse search — see "SyncTeX" below.
  sync_dir = '~/.overleaf',

  -- SumatraPDF binary, used for SyncTeX forward search (Windows only)
  sumatra_path = 'SumatraPDF.exe',

  -- Neovim binary, used by the SyncTeX inverse-search helper to reach this instance
  nvim_path = 'nvim',

  -- Set to false to disable default keymaps
  keys = true,
})
```

## Workflow

1. `:Overleaf` — authenticate and select a project
2. File tree appears — press `Enter` to open a document
3. Edit normally — changes sync to Overleaf in real-time
4. `:w` — triggers compile and opens PDF
5. `:Overleaf tree` — switch between documents

## External Tool Integration (Claude Code, etc.)

By default, Overleaf documents exist only as virtual buffers — they have no files on disk. This means external tools like Claude Code cannot read or edit them.

Set `sync_dir` to enable local file mirroring:

```lua
require('overleaf').setup({
  sync_dir = '~/.overleaf',  -- or any directory
})
```

When connected to a project, all text documents are synced to `~/.overleaf/<project-name>/`. External tools can read and edit these files — changes are automatically detected and synced back to Overleaf.

### How it works

- **On connect**: all documents are fetched and written to disk
- **Neovim edits**: debounced writes keep disk files up to date
- **Remote edits**: disk files are updated when collaborators make changes
- **External edits**: file watchers detect changes and sync them to Overleaf via OT
  - For open documents: buffer is updated, triggering the normal OT pipeline
  - For closed documents: changes are sent directly via the bridge

### Commands

- `:Overleaf sync` — re-sync all documents (fetch from Overleaf and write to disk)
- `:Overleaf sync import` — import all external disk changes to Overleaf
- `:Overleaf sync export` — export all documents to disk

### Usage with Claude Code

```bash
# Start Claude Code in the sync directory
cd ~/.overleaf/My\ Project
claude
```

Claude Code can now read all your LaTeX files and make edits that sync back to Overleaf in real-time.

## SyncTeX (forward/inverse search)

Jump between a position in your `.tex` source and the matching location in the compiled PDF, in both directions. Currently supported on **Windows with SumatraPDF** only.

Requires `sync_dir` to be set (SyncTeX only knows about real file paths, so documents must be mirrored to disk — see [External Tool Integration](#external-tool-integration-claude-code-etc) above).

### Forward search (nvim → PDF)

Run `:Overleaf forwardsearch` (or `<leader>ov`) with the cursor on the line you want to find. It opens/reuses a SumatraPDF window and jumps to the matching page and position. The PDF and its `.synctex.gz` are downloaded automatically after each `:Overleaf compile`.

### Inverse search (PDF → nvim)

Double-click a location in SumatraPDF to jump to the matching line in Neovim.

One-time setup: open SumatraPDF → **Settings → Options** → set **"Set inverse search command line"** to:

```
node "<path-to-overleaf.nvim>/node/inverse-search.js" "%f" %l
```

(replace `<path-to-overleaf.nvim>` with your plugin install path, e.g. the output of `:lua print(require('overleaf.config').plugin_root())`). This only needs to be done once — SumatraPDF remembers it across PDFs and restarts.

Under the hood: on `setup()`, the plugin starts a `--listen` server and publishes its address to `stdpath('data')/overleaf-nvim-server.txt`. SumatraPDF runs the helper script above on double-click, which reads that address and reaches your running Neovim via `nvim --server <addr> --remote-expr`.

### Limitations

- Windows + SumatraPDF only for now (macOS/Linux viewers with SyncTeX support — Skim, Zathura — could be added the same way).
- Inverse search moves the cursor but does not steal window focus from the PDF viewer.
- Only one Neovim instance's address is published at a time; with multiple instances open, inverse search reaches whichever one ran `setup()` most recently.

## How It Works

The plugin spawns a Node.js bridge process that connects to Overleaf's real-time collaboration server via Socket.IO. Edits in Neovim are converted to OT operations and sent to the server. Remote edits from other collaborators are transformed and applied to your buffer in real-time.

## Disclaimer

This is an **unofficial** plugin and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). It relies on Overleaf's internal real-time collaboration protocol, which is undocumented and may change at any time without notice. Such changes could cause the plugin to stop working, or in the worst case, lead to document corruption or data loss.

Overleaf maintains version history for all projects, so you can restore previous versions from the Overleaf web interface if anything goes wrong.

**Use this plugin at your own risk.** Always keep important work backed up.
