# overleaf.nvim

Neovim plugin for real-time collaborative LaTeX editing on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

Edit your Overleaf projects directly in Neovim with full real-time collaboration support via Operational Transformation (OT). Use your favorite Neovim plugins — treesitter, LSP, snippets, copilot, and more — while collaborating with others on Overleaf.

## Features

- **Real-time collaboration** — edits sync instantly with other Overleaf users via OT
- **Full Neovim ecosystem** — treesitter, LSP, snippets, copilot, and all your plugins work out of the box
- **File tree** — browse and manage project files in a sidebar
- **Auto-authentication** — extracts session cookie from Chrome automatically (macOS)
- **Auto-reconnect** — recovers from disconnects and document restores seamlessly
- **Compile & PDF preview** — compile LaTeX and open the PDF
- **Comments & reviews** — view, reply, resolve comment threads
- **Collaborator cursors** — see where other users are editing
- **Project-wide search** — grep across all documents
- **File management** — create, delete, rename, upload files
- **History** — view project version history
- **Diagnostics** — chktex linter + LaTeX compile errors via `vim.diagnostic`
- **LSP support** — auto-attaches texlab, ltex, harper_ls to overleaf buffers
- **Local file sync** — mirror documents to disk for external tools (Claude Code, etc.)

## Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.10
- Node.js >= 18
- An [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) account
- Chrome / Chromium (for automatic cookie extraction) or a session cookie

## Installation

### lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  'richwomanbtc/overleaf.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('overleaf').setup()
  end,
  build = 'cd node && npm install',
}
```

If Node.js is not on your default PATH (e.g., installed via Homebrew on macOS):

```lua
{
  'richwomanbtc/overleaf.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('overleaf').setup({
      node_path = '/opt/homebrew/bin/node',
    })
  end,
  build = 'cd node && npm install',
}
```

### Manual

```sh
git clone https://github.com/richwomanbtc/overleaf.nvim ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/overleaf.nvim
cd ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/overleaf.nvim/node && npm install
```

## Authentication

### Option 1: Chrome (automatic)

Just log in to [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com) in Chrome. The plugin extracts the session cookie automatically. If you have multiple Chrome profiles, you'll be prompted to select one.

### Option 2: Manual cookie

Create a `.env` file in your working directory:

```
OVERLEAF_COOKIE=your_overleaf_session2_cookie_here
```

Or pass it directly in setup:

```lua
require('overleaf').setup({
  cookie = 'your_overleaf_session2_cookie_here',
})
```

> **Warning:** If you use this method, make sure your Neovim config is not committed to a public dotfiles repository — the cookie would grant full access to your Overleaf account.

To get the cookie manually: open overleaf.com in your browser → DevTools (F12) → Application → Cookies → `www.overleaf.com` → find `overleaf_session2` → copy the cookie value (starts with `overleaf_session2=s%3A...`).

## Configuration

```lua
require('overleaf').setup({
  -- Path to .env file containing OVERLEAF_COOKIE (default: '.env')
  env_file = '.env',

  -- Session cookie (overrides .env)
  cookie = nil,

  -- Path to Node.js binary (default: 'node')
  node_path = 'node',

  -- Log level: 'debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error' (default: 'info')
  log_level = 'info',

  -- Local file sync directory for external tools like Claude Code (default: nil = disabled)
  -- When set, all documents are mirrored to disk and external changes are synced back.
  sync_dir = '~/.overleaf',

  -- SumatraPDF binary, used for SyncTeX forward search (Windows only)
  sumatra_path = 'SumatraPDF.exe',

  -- Set to false to disable default keymaps
  keys = true,
})
```

## Workflow

1. `:Overleaf` — authenticate and select a project
2. File tree appears — press `Enter` to open a document
3. Edit normally — changes sync to Overleaf in real-time
4. `:w` — triggers compile and opens PDF
5. `:Overleaf tree` — switch between documents

## External Tool Integration (Claude Code, etc.)

By default, Overleaf documents exist only as virtual buffers — they have no files on disk. This means external tools like Claude Code cannot read or edit them.

Set `sync_dir` to enable local file mirroring:

```lua
require('overleaf').setup({
  sync_dir = '~/.overleaf',  -- or any directory
})
```

When connected to a project, all text documents are synced to `~/.overleaf/<project-name>/`. External tools can read and edit these files — changes are automatically detected and synced back to Overleaf.

### How it works

- **On connect**: all documents are fetched and written to disk
- **Neovim edits**: debounced writes keep disk files up to date
- **Remote edits**: disk files are updated when collaborators make changes
- **External edits**: file watchers detect changes and sync them to Overleaf via OT
  - For open documents: buffer is updated, triggering the normal OT pipeline
  - For closed documents: changes are sent directly via the bridge

### Commands

- `:Overleaf sync` — re-sync all documents (fetch from Overleaf and write to disk)
- `:Overleaf sync import` — import all external disk changes to Overleaf
- `:Overleaf sync export` — export all documents to disk

### Usage with Claude Code

```bash
# Start Claude Code in the sync directory
cd ~/.overleaf/My\ Project
claude
```

Claude Code can now read all your LaTeX files and make edits that sync back to Overleaf in real-time.

## SyncTeX forward search (nvim → PDF) — ⚠️ known issue, not currently working

`:Overleaf forwardsearch` (or `<leader>ov`) is meant to jump from the cursor in your `.tex` source to the matching page in the compiled PDF, via SumatraPDF on Windows. **As currently implemented it does not reliably work against overleaf.com** and usually reports "No matching PDF location found for this line."

What's confirmed, for anyone picking this up:

- Overleaf doesn't serve a compile's raw `.synctex.gz` for direct download (its own web client doesn't either — confirmed via a consistent 503), so this can't hand a local SyncTeX table to a PDF viewer's own `-forward-search`. It instead calls Overleaf's own `/project/<id>/sync/code` endpoint — the same one the web editor's "jump to PDF" button uses — which returns a page + position directly.
- The request this sends has been verified byte-for-byte identical (query params — `file`, `line`, `column`, `editorId`, `buildId`, `clsiserverid` — and headers, including `X-Csrf-Token`) to a captured request from Overleaf's own web UI for the same project/file/line, including replaying the exact generated URL directly in a browser tab (same cookies), which also comes back empty.
- A controlled A/B test showed a fresh build compiled via Overleaf's own "Recompile" button *can* be forward-searched successfully; a fresh build compiled through `:Overleaf compile` moments later, same project/account, consistently cannot — so something about how this plugin triggers the compile produces a build `sync/code` can't resolve against, even though the resulting PDF/log are otherwise fine.
- Sending `editorId` and `rootDoc_id` with the compile request (matching Overleaf's web client, which this plugin's compile request was missing) were both tried as the fix and neither changed the outcome.

Not yet root-caused beyond this — see the comment at the top of `lua/overleaf/synctex.lua` for the full trail. Next step would be comparing raw network traffic (e.g. via a proxy) between the browser and this plugin's Node bridge, which wasn't possible in the environment this was debugged in.

**Inverse search (double-click in the PDF → jump in Neovim) isn't implemented at all**, independent of the above: SumatraPDF only invokes an external command on double-click when it has resolved the click itself from a local SyncTeX table, which isn't available here either way.

## How It Works

The plugin spawns a Node.js bridge process that connects to Overleaf's real-time collaboration server via Socket.IO. Edits in Neovim are converted to OT operations and sent to the server. Remote edits from other collaborators are transformed and applied to your buffer in real-time.

## Disclaimer

This is an **unofficial** plugin and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). It relies on Overleaf's internal real-time collaboration protocol, which is undocumented and may change at any time without notice. Such changes could cause the plugin to stop working, or in the worst case, lead to document corruption or data loss.

Overleaf maintains version history for all projects, so you can restore previous versions from the Overleaf web interface if anything goes wrong.

**Use this plugin at your own risk.** Always keep important work backed up.
